This is the documentation of the Agent-Based safety risk model. It was developed by Bastiaan Zwanenburg (bastiaanzwanenburg@gmail.com) as part of a Master Thesis project at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering at TU Delft.

How the program works: either model.py (no visualization, faster) or run.py (visualization, slower) should be run. It simulates the third party risk following from UAS package delivery operations in the cities of Delft, NY or Paris.
